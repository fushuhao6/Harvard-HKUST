# How to use this repo

The lib folder contains the libraries we need. Put them to your [what ever the path is]/Arduino/libraries/
For example, for me it is /home/sfuab/Arduino/libraries/.

The test folder contains code you can test with the library files. You can just put them in you Arduino folder and open it.
